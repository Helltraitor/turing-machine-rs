//! Provides [`Instruction`] and it's components: [`Head`], [`Move`],
//! [`State`], [`Tail`].
//!
//! This module provides a unit struct named [`Instruction`] for implementing
//! this type for any type that implements [`Symbol`] trait.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Creating a new [`Instruction`] through the [`Instruction::new`] method:
//! ```rust
//! use turing_machine_rs::instruction::{Head, Instruction, Move, State, Tail};
//!
//! let head = Head::new(State(1), '0');
//! let tail = Tail::new(State(0), '0', Move::Right);
//!
//! // Moves head and tail from the scope
//! let inst = Instruction::new(head, tail);
//! ```
//!
//! Creating a new [`Instruction`] through the [`Instruction::build`] method:
//! ```rust
//! use turing_machine_rs::instruction::{Instruction, Move, State};
//!
//! let inst = Instruction::build(State(1), '0', State(0), '0', Move::Right);
//! ```
