### Binary addition
Binary addition is a turing machine that can calculate two binary numbers added. This machine translates tape `a+b` into ` c `, where c is a + b. This machine always leaves empty symbols before and after because this is the only way to check if this is the end (begin) of a number.

### Hyper machine
Hyper machine is the turing machine for translating tapes from "choose second argument" to "choose third argument". Instead of char or whatever else symbols are, this machine works with other turing machines.

### Nice Test
The most basic machine translates `nice` to `test` and `test` to `nice` words.This machine is a good place to quickly start.
