### Binary addition
Binary addition is a turing machine which can calculate two binary numbers addition. This machine translates tape `a+b` into ` c `, where c is a + b. This machine always leave empty symbols before and after because this is the only one way to check is this the end (begin) of number.

### Hyper machine
Hyper machine is the turing machine for translating tape "choose second argument" to "choose third argument". Instead of char or whatever else symbols this machine works with other turing machines.

### Nice Test
Simplest machine which translate "nice" to "test" and "test" to "nice" words. This machine is a good place to quick start.
